# wasm-face-tracking

Pretty much just a standalone version for [this](https://github.com/conix-center/ARENA-core/tree/master/face-tracking)

## Building

Download and install [emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) (version 1.39.16 works best), [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), and [dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib). Build WASM for [opencv_js](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/da1/tutorial_js_setup.html).

Run ```npm run build``` to build.
